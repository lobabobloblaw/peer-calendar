## Tips for those with social anxiety

Many programs in this guide are designed by people with lived mental health experience who understand social challenges:

**Lower-pressure activities:**
- **Disc golf** – outdoor, self-paced, can go alone
- **Board game meetups** – structured activity helps conversation flow naturally
- **Library programs** – familiar environment, quiet spaces available
- **Walking groups** – side-by-side interaction is often easier than face-to-face
- **Movie theaters** – dark, quiet, solo-friendly

**What to expect at peer support groups:**
- No pressure to share or talk
- Others understand because they've experienced similar challenges
- Drop-in format means no commitment
- Virtual/Zoom options available for most NAMI groups
- You can leave anytime

**Quieter times and spaces:**
- **Smith and Bybee Wetlands** – very few visitors, especially weekdays
- **Powell Butte** – weekday mornings in the meadows
- Community centers – ask staff for quieter times
- Yoga studios – trauma-informed classes use invitational language ("you might try..." not "do this")

**First-time tips:**
- Call ahead to ask what to expect
- Visit during less busy times
- Bring a support person if helpful
- Start with online/phone options before in-person
- It's okay to observe without participating

## Conclusion: Start with three steps

The resources in this guide can genuinely transform access to community life on a limited budget. **Start with these three high-impact steps:**

1. **Enroll in PP&R Access Discount** (portland.gov/parks/discount) – Receive up to 90% off pools, classes, and community centers with no income verification required.

2. **Apply for TriMet Low-Income Fare** (trimet.org/income) – Get a free first month pass plus $28/month unlimited transit throughout the metro area.

3. **Get your library card** (any county library) – Access free museum passes, streaming services, classes, and thousands of programs at no cost.

These three steps alone can provide affordable fitness, transportation to activities, and free cultural access. From there, explore peer support at FolkTime or NAMI, try donation-based yoga, visit a farmers market with Double Up Food Bucks, or find your local community garden. Portland's network of free and low-cost resources is remarkably deep—and most programs explicitly welcome newcomers who may be taking their first steps back into community life.
