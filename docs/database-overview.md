## What Makes It Useful?

Each resource includes:

- **Address and phone number** — for people without internet access
- **Cost** — what it costs and what discounts are available
- **Who qualifies** — eligibility requirements spelled out clearly
- **First-visit tips** — what to expect, what to bring, how to sign up
- **Accessibility info** — wheelchair access, transit nearby, etc.
- **Social comfort level** — whether it's a solo activity or group setting

---

## How Is It Kept Accurate?

Every resource is **verified using official sources** (not just Google searches). Each entry has a scheduled check-up — some monthly, some quarterly — to catch changes in hours, prices, or programs.

A simple audit system tracks:
- When each resource was last verified
- When it's due for another check
- Any changes that were found

## How Can People Use It?

The information can be shared in several ways:

1. **Printed guides** — Handouts for people who prefer paper
2. **Calendar subscriptions** — Events appear automatically on phone/computer calendars
3. **Staff reference** — Quick lookups during peer support sessions

## Why Does This Matter?

Finding affordable activities and services is hard. Information online is often outdated, scattered across dozens of websites, or assumes you already know how things work.

This guide puts everything in one place, written in plain language, and keeps it current — so peer specialists can confidently share accurate information with the people they support.
